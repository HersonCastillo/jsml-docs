# Helpers

An helper is a function that will help you to write less code and less logic.
Some helpers are still in development, so if you have another way to do something, just keep that.

Currently JSML have these helpers:

- useForm
- usePath
- ref
- tag

All of them can be extracted from `@duox/jsml` package.

Soon I will upload a documentation of its use!

Enjoy it!
